## Cleaned data of missing persons list from the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances in Pakistan

This spreadsheet contains data from Pakistan's [Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances](http://coioed.pk/)’ list of missing persons as of 20 June 2022. 

The Commission, which has been operational since 2011, records entries as it receives applications of missing persons cases across Pakistan, including those reported to have disappeared before the Commission was formed.

The dataset has been cleaned and contents of the status of cases have been disaggregated into subcategories. 

The analysis and conclusions derived from this dataset have informed reporting by Reem Khurshid on the article ‘[Acts of omission: How Pakistan fails to address impunity for enforced disappearances](http://www.gawah.org/acts-of-omission/)’ published by Gawah in October 2022. 

The article was published as part of her dissertation project for MSc Computational and Data Journalism (2021-22) at Cardiff University.

[Gawah](https://www.gawah.org/) is an initiative by a collective of concerned citizens, including journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders, who aim to:

- Bring focus to the plight of missing persons and their families.

- Amplify the work of groups on the ground in organising to end enforced disappearances.

- Promote a Pakistan in which the civil liberties of all people are secure.
